## 1. How to add and update files on GitHub:



1. Create a new repository on Github.com

   Go to git bash
   First go to the directory where you want to clone
   clone <link>
   It will create the copy of the repository
   now add both files in it-cisco packet tracer and readme(change its name)
   then go to git bash and go to repository folder
2. git add * (it will add everything new to the repository)
   git commit -m "hello"(any message)
   git push
3. For updating any files:
   1. go in the repository on your local machine.
   2. git pull- this will merge all the files from github repository into your local repository. But it will not change the local repository.
